# It's Just Text

What if there was a way to convey an idea over a long distance such
that anyone regardless of age, physical condition, available equipment
or bandwidth can access it?

Introducing: __It's Just Text__.  The lowest common denominator of the
communication on the Internet.

## Only 3 Rules To Go By

  - Content is what matters.  Use plain text with no formatting other
    than emphasis and headers which facilitate reading.

  - Wrapping and whitespace are part of your content: control them.
    Structure your ideas with whitespace.  Wrap at the 72nd character;
    it reads well, zooms well and fits multiple documents side-by-side.

  - Forgo all interaction.  Don't store state, don't use dynamic
    elements, don't listen to events.


## Getting Started

__It's Just Text__ is a manifesto.  You can literally upload a *.txt
file to your server and you're good.

But what if you want to embed an image in your document?  Or make it
easier for the reader to refer to other hyperlinked documents?  It's
the World Wide Web after all!

I wrote a tiny JavaScript library which parses plain text files using
a minimal Markdown-like syntax and produces a valid HTML document:
[itsjusttext].  It's licensed under the MIT license.  You're welcome
to create your own variation which best serves your needs.

Put the following HTML at the top of your text file.  Edit the title
and make sure the file is served as HTML (usually by changing its
extension to *.html).

   &lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html lang=en&gt;&lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;
   &lt;script defer src="itsjusttext.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;It's Just Text&lt;/title&gt;

That's it!  The JavaScript code is fast and extremely lean, weighing in
at just 0.5 KB.  It will mark up your content in a minimal way as
described in the next section.


## What's Included

  - Your content, exactly how you wrote it.
  - Three levels of headings: #&nbsp;hello
  - Emphasis: _&zwj;_hi there__,
  - Links with references: [howdy].
  - Images via the &lt;img&gt; element.
  - And any other HTML as well, actually.
